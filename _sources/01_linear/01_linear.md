# linear / non-ninear behaviour

In continuum mechanics, there are different types of nonlinear system behavior:
- nonlinear boundary conditions (e.g. changing contact conditions), A
- nonlinear deformation, B
- nonlinear material behavior, C

The linearization is in many cases a very simplified assumption that only represents the real behaviour of a system with sufficient accuracy under certain boundary conditions.


In engineering practice, the advantage of linearization lies in the reduction of the calculation effort. Due to the possibility of simply superimposing different load cases linearly, it is not necessary to calculate each load case individually (and fully transient). Even with increasing computing power this is still not possible with reasonable effort for complex systems. Linearization is therefore an essential and necessary simplification "to get things solved". But special failure mechanisms such as buckling or the analysis of large strains cannot be assessed with a linear calculation alone. The application limits must therefore be carefully observed!
